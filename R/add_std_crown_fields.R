#' Assign STD_VRI, CROWN_BEAR and CROWN_MOOSE
#'
#' This script takes an input VRI feature class and adds two new field, STD_VRI,
#' CROWN_BEAR and CROWN_MOOSE. It populates the STD_VRI field "C", "B" or "M" based
#' on the existing values in the SPECIES_CD_# and SPECIES_PCT_# fields, and populates
#' the CROWN_BEAR field with codes 1 to 4, and CROWN_MOOSE with codes H, M, L, VL and N
#' based on the existing values in the CROWN_CLOSURE field.
#'
#' @param vri data.table object that represent VRI (vegetation resources inventory) features
#' @return sf object
#' @import data.table
